MNIST MEDICAL 

58954 Images of different medical images  ranging from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to  computed tomography scans (CT SCANS)
Classes of the images are listed as being one of the following
AbdomenCT
BreastMRI
CXR
ChestCT
Hand
HeadCT

1)
Looking at what question we are trying to solve or analyse. 
Identifying what part of the human body it is and the further benefits this can give having already classed regular imagery.

* Background infomation on MRI's: *
They are magnet scans that use radio waves and computers to produce images. There are 2 types open and closed MRI's. Closed MRI's where originally more traditionally nevertheless people can become claustrophobic in these closed MRI's.With modern medicine and technology improving at a rapid rate open MRI's are producing higher quality imagery than they once did. One of the benefits to MRI's is that they do not involve radiation. Some of the injuries that an MRI can detect are listed below

MRI of the brain and spinal cord can detect:
brain aneurysms
brain injury
eye or ear issues
pinched nerves
multiple sclerosis (MS)
stroke
tumors of the brain or spine

MRI of the cardiovascular system can evaluate:
the anatomical structure of the heart
blockages or other issues
blood flow through the arteries and vessels
congenital heart disease
damage from heart attacks
the function of the heart
infection, tumors, and inflammation

Other uses for MRI include:
detecting tumors and cancer throughout the body, including breast cancer
identifying other issues with organs (brain, heart, lungs, digestive organs)
visualizing soft tissue injuries (ligaments, tendons, muscles)
revealing joint disease and injury


* Background infomation on CT Scans: *
A computed tomography scan is often done when Xrays or ultrasounding testing isnt producing a clear and conclusive image. 
The CT scan can be used to produce a more detailed picture of blood vessels, tissues and even bones. 
CT scans may involve different dyes going into the body so that they can increase the contrast level of the imagery.
CT scans shall exposue people to radiadation and the contrast dyes may cause an allergic reaction for some people.
Nevertheless the idea behind the contrast dye is to get a clearer image and hopefully prevent the need for further scans.
