## Introduction
The project will create a predictive model of an MRI/CT Scan from one of 6 classes. The project is based on a MNIST data set was put together by BibTeX in 2017 and contains medical images that are 64x64.
There are 58954 medical images that belong to 6 different classes that have been provided for this model to be trained on.
These images where orginally taken from various other data sets and converted into the 64x64 style. 


### Repository Structure
The root directory contains:
-README.md

Other directories:
Admin(Folder)-  'workinglog.txt', 'medical.txt'. 'Project4.docx'
Images(Folder)-contains all images used in the README.

### Dataset
Retrieved data from the following website: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/medical-mnist/data?select=AbdomenCT]

__Dataset Limitations__
- There are only 6 classes of scans that have been provided.

## Results
###### The model achieves x precision, and x accuracy when prediciting which class an image, from one of the 6 relevant classes, belongs to.
