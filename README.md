## Introduction
The project will create a predictive model of an MRI/CT Scan from one of 6 classes. The project is based on a MNIST data set was put together by BibTeX in 2017 and contains medical images that are 64x64.<br>
There are 58954 medical images that belong to 6 different classes that have been provided for this model to be trained on.<br>
These images where orginally taken from various other data sets and converted into the 64x64 style. <br>


### Repository Structure
The root directory contains:
-README.md

Other directories:
Data(Folder)- Contains 58954 medical images of a 64x64 style.<br>
Admin(Folder)-  'workinglog.txt', 'medical.txt'. 'Project4.docx'<br>
Images(Folder)-contains all images used in the README.<br>

### Dataset
Retrieved data from the following website: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/medical-mnist/data?select=AbdomenCT] <br>
The Dataset was then uploaded to the GitHub Repository at the following website: [ x ] 

__Dataset Limitations__
- There are only 6 classes of scans that have been provided.

## Results
###### The model achieves x precision, and x accuracy when prediciting which class an image, from one of the 6 relevant classes, belongs to. 

### Analysis and Future Questions
A deeper intention behind this model is to put together a database of various scans with different health complications so that<br>
future models are able to predict/identify health problems earlier by scanning over the images and highlighting possible concerns.<br> </p>
