  <h2>Predicting Scans Based on Images</h2>
  <section>



    <p>Highlighted below are the different types of images that can be identfied using the model that we have made. 
      This model aims to assist the medical industry in quickly labelling and grouping each image automatically.
      A deeper intention behind this model is to put together a database of various scans with different health complications so that
      future models are able to predict/identify health problems earlier by scanning over the images and highlighting possible concerns. </p>
