  <h2>Predicting Scans Based on Images</h2>
  <section>

  <h3>Overview of the data</h3>
      <p>This  MNIST data set was put together by BibTeX in 2017 and contains medical images taht are 64x64.<br>
        There are 58954 medical images that belong to 6 different classes that have been provided for this model to be trained on. <br>
        These images where orginally taken from various other data sets and converted into the 64x64 style. <br></p>   
    <br />

    <p>Highlighted below are the different types of images that can be identfied using the model that we have made. <br>
      This model aims to assist the medical industry in quickly labelling and grouping each image automatically.<br>
      A deeper intention behind this model is to put together a database of various scans with different health complications so that<br>
      future models are able to predict/identify health problems earlier by scanning over the images and highlighting possible concerns.<br> </p>
