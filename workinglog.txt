#Going about starting the project
The aim of our project is to uncover patterns in images provided to us from the MNIST Dataset to be able to correctly identify the type of scan taken. 
We shall be looking into the relationship our testing model creates and the accuracy with which it predicts the image scanned. 
##Working log:
Pre 19/12/23 looking at Vet clinics and infomation on them, APIs. Formed vet.txt file.

19/12/23 Decided on the MNIST MEDICAL  dataset. Created Medical.txt

Author of this data set is 
BibTeX
@misc{Medical MNIST Classification,
author = {apolanco3225},
title = {Medical MNIST Classification},
year = {2017},
publisher = {GitHub},
journal = {GitHub repository},
howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/apolanco3225/Medical-MNIST-Classification}}
}

##Project Requirements + how we will meet them:

1) Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.

The problem is the accuracy at which machines can determine which human body part has been scanned with a CT or MRI automatically. 
If this was correctly fixed and adjusted for, the findings/code could go on to be used to assist with the identification  of medical problems for patients with great accuracy and speed. This would benefit the medical community.

2) You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library.

We have decided to use Scikit-learn for predictions. 
Nevertheless tensorflow.keras may also be used. 

3) You must use at least two of the following: Python Pandas, Python Matplotlib, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript Plotly, JavaScript Leaflet, Tableau, SQL Database, MongoDB Database, Google Cloud SQL, Amazon AWS.

From the following list we shall use at least: Python Pandas and Python Matplotlib. 

4) The data set that shall be used is the MNIST Medical, containing 58954 Images, which can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/medical-mnist

5) Back end ETL (Adam thinks this is taken care of by the images already being categorized by type of scan already, This saves us having to move scanned images into particularly folders. 
Nevertheless we may need to transform all images to a specific size(scale all to the same)
6) Provide Visualizations: Scatter plots, Graphs, Images of data. Prediction vs actual models.
